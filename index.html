    <i>The Hardest I Have Learnt</i><br>
I think I understand the d3 algorithm pretty well even though I don’t think I know other Java Script that well. In my opinion, the reason that I know d3 is I can easily map it in my mind as a process of creating the visual element you want. The steps to make it happen are clear. Select, selectall, data, enter, append and decorate it. It is like a streamline in my mind. As long as I follow it (of course there are some simplification we can make), I can get the result I want.  That is why I know exactly how to do it.<br><br>

    <i>The Hardest Thing I Have Not Yet Learned</i><br>
Some of the Java Script are still not clear in my mind. I mean I know how to do the lab as I can learn from how Dr. B does it and I can ask for help. And many of the problems in the single lab are kinds of similar. However, it is hard for me to do another similar problem without any help or guidance. It is not because I don’t know the idea as I know the process, but it is just easier to make mistakes in some specific codes and cannot find the reason behind. I think that is because my knowledges / understandings of many of those basic JS are not solid that I can make some easy mistakes while not noticing those mistakes. For instance, I can make mistake in using “.” while using “,” is right.  All of those are like details.
